<p>As expected, the Covid-19 pandemic caused a strong decline in bike rentals in spring of 2020, as people tended to stay at home and not rent bikes to go to work or on excursions. In May and June of 2021, the nr. of bike rentals increased, likely due to a reduction of Covid-19 restrictions and better weather conditions.</p>

<p>Both mean and median values can provide helpful information when creating these kinds of graphs. With mean values, more weight is given to outlier values. This could be interesting to capture the effect of for example a strike of train drivers. Median values are more helpful when the goal is to show more normalized values (normalized as in less impacted by outlier values).</p>
