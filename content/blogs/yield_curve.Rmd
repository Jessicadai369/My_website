# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data_new", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve


### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)

#releveling and renaming the factor levels
yield_curve_2<- yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity)) %>% 
  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity, c("3m", "6m", "1y", "2y", "3y", "5y", "7y", "10y", "20y", "30y"))) %>% 
  mutate(maturity=fct_recode(maturity,"3-Month Treasury Bill"= "3m", "6-Month Treasury Bill" = "6m", "1-Year Treasury Rate"= "1y","2-Year Treasury Rate"= "2y", "3-Year Treasury Rate"="3y","5-Year Treasury Rate"= "5y","7-Year Treasury Rate"= "7y","10-Year Treasury Rate"= "10y", "20-Year Treasury Rate"="20y", "30-Year Treasury Rate"="30y" ))

#plotting the data
ggplot(yield_curve_2, aes(x=date, y=value, color=maturity))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~maturity, ncol=2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title="Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       y="%",
       x="",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")


```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)

#releveling the maturity factor and filtering for 1999-2021
yield_curve_3<-yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity)) %>% 
  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity, c("3m", "6m", "1y", "2y", "3y", "5y", "7y", "10y", "20y", "30y"))) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date)) %>%  
  filter(year>1998)

#plotting using the "group" assignment to group by dates
ggplot(yield_curve_3, aes(x=maturity, y=value, color=year, group = date))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol=4)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title="US Yield Curve",
       y="%",
       x="Maturity",
       caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")


```
Because the yield curve inverted prior to crises for several times, for example in 2008, it is widely regarded as a crisis predictor. In 2021, the yield curve is characterized by very low yields across different maturities. 


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)


#filtering for maturities "3m" and "10y" as well as 1999-2021
yield_curve_4 <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(maturity == c("3m","10y")) %>% 
  filter(year(date) >= 1999)

#plotting the 
ggplot(yield_curve_4, aes(x=date,y=value,color = duration))+
    geom_line()+
    labs(title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
    subtitle = "",
    x = "",
    y="%",
    fill="",
    caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
    theme_bw()+ 
    theme(legend.title=element_blank())

```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)


recessions

recessions_new<- recessions[-c(1,2,3),]


```


```{r curve_final, warning=FALSE}
data_final<- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(maturity == c("3m","10y")) %>% 
  select(-series_id,-duration) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = maturity,values_from = value)

colnames(data_final) <- c( "date","three_month","ten_year")


data_final<- data_final %>% 
  mutate(diff = ten_year - three_month)%>% 
  mutate(
    up =ifelse(diff>0,diff,0),
    down =ifelse(diff<0,diff,0)
  )



graph_final <- ggplot(data_final,aes(x=date,group=1))+
  geom_line(aes(y=diff))+
    theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Yield Curve Inversion:10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury rates",
    subtitle = "difference in % point monthly average. Shaded areas correspond to recessions",
    y= "Difference (10 year - 3month) yield in %",
    x= "Year")+
  geom_ribbon(
    aes(ymin=0, ymax=up+0), fill="light blue"
  )+
geom_ribbon(
    aes(ymax=0, ymin=down+0),fill="#CB454A"
  )+
geom_rug(aes(colour=ifelse(ten_year>=three_month,">=0","<0")),sides="b")+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("#CB454A","light blue"), guide=FALSE)+
   annotate("rect", fill = "grey", alpha = 0.5, 
        xmin =recessions_new$From, xmax = recessions_new$To,
        ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf)

graph_final
