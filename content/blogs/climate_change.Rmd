# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```



```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(1:13) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13,
               names_to="Month",
               values_to="delta")
```



```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies", 
    subtitle = "Measured as deviations from base value in degrees celsius", 
    y="Temperature deviation from base value", 
    x="Year"
    )

```

From the graph it becomes very clear that since c. 1975, temperature deviations from the base value have consistently increased. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw()+ 
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    subtitle = "Measured as deviations from base value in degrees celsius",
    y="Temperature deviation from base value", 
    x="Year")+
  facet_wrap(~month)
```

These charts show that temperature deviations in individual months vary between each other. For instance, in the winter months (December, January, February), deviations are particularly significant when compared to the summer months (June, July). Especially in areas with a lot of permafrost and icecaps, warmer winters can cause substantial ice-melts. 


```{r intervals, results="hide"}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```



```{r density_plot, results="hide"}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density")         #changing y-axis label to sentence case

```

The key message of this graph is that in the most recent time interval (2011-present), monthly temperature anomalies are particularly common. These anomalies are (about) normally distributed around +1 degrees.


```{r averaging, results="hide"}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta=mean(delta,  na.rm=TRUE)) 
  

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method="loess") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```



```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, results="hide"}

formula_ci <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            t_critical=qt(0.975,n()-1),
            sd=sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE), 
            count=n(),
            se=sd/(count)^(1/2), 
            lower_CI=mean-t_critical*se, 
            upper_CI=mean+t_critical*se)

formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

boot_delta<-comparison %>% 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% 
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat="mean")

percentile_CI<-boot_delta %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type="percentile")
percentile_CI

```



To find the lower and upper confidence intervals, we generated 1000 artificial samples of data and calculated their respective means. Out of these means, the 25th lowest corresponds to the lower confidence interval (1.01) and the 975th highest corresponds to the upper confidence interval (1.11). Based on this data, we can be 95% confident that the average temperature anomaly of the time period 2011-present lies between 1.01-1.11 degrees. Clearly, this is supportive of climate change.    



```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}

global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data_new", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```




```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  filter(response ==c("Not warming","Earth is warming")) %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)

#4 proportion CIs, where x=nr. of people who believe earth is warming

#Conservative Republican
prop.test(x=124, n=349, conf.level = 0.95)

#Liberal Democrat 
prop.test(x=202, n=213, conf.level = 0.95)

#Mod/Cons Democrat
prop.test(x=281, n=360, conf.level = 0.95)

#Mod/Lib Republican
prop.test(x=68, n=136, conf.level = 0.95)


```

As one would assume, the population proportion estimates indicate that conservative republicans are particularly sceptical towards the notion of a warming climate. In contrast, liberal democrats almost uniformly agree with the claim that the climate is warming. Even among more conservative democrats, a high proportion agrees that the climate is warming. Among moderate republicans, there is a high chance that opinions on the topic are about equally split.
