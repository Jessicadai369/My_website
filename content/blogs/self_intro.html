<pre class="r"><code># I am originally from Zhengzhou, China and I like traveling, embracing different cultures and learning languages, so I have studied in several different locations like Hong Kong, South Korea and Shanghai. In my spare time, I am an art fanatic and have a passion for fashion design. I not-so-secretly stalk Vera Wangâ€™s wedding dress designs, because I believe that looking at beautiful things can make our lives a little brighter. Last summer, I worked at TusStar, a venture capital firm focusing on second- and third-tier markets like Zhengzhou, rather than focusing their attentions on areas like Beijing and Shanghai, where so many other investment firms pool their energies. This experience made me excited to continue delving into investment opportunities in overlooked markets and SMBs post-graduation.</code></pre>
